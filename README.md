### GB-1 - Create the frontend boilerplate

#### Description

In order to get started and have code that the rest of the team can develop on, we need some sort of scaffolded structure in place.

#### ACs

- Use `npx create-react-app` to generate the basic boilerplate for the frontend in a **separate** frontend repo.
- Should have the basic app in a deployable state if you wanted e.g. if I check it out and run it - I can see the react app.
- Cleanup the `src/` folder so that it's in a simple workable state
- Install `react-bootstrap` to aid our component creation and 'solution' acquiring
